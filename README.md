## Project Scope: Be as specific as possible with the scope of your project (which should be as narrowly focused as possible.)

Short Term Scope: Create an AI model that can evaluate short typed essays. Create a simple website demo that can evaluate thesis statements. 



## Project Details: With logical organization and clear but concise writeups.

[Essay Introduction Evaluator](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxRluQljBoN2PC1dW4iDnAkObKuLUhs7R7orDWjLOWQ7Kjl9WJb4yvy1V0dmwD0XWM/exec): initial model to evaluate single thesis statement.

[Essay Grader](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzGV3livLefoWqqA5_ESHbr2LCdNVGhEmmOcsFRCfuj_8Xir6s-3nOGmptz_W9oUvQX/exec): expanded model to evaluate multi-paragraph essay. 

## What are future developments?

Mid Term Scope: Merge model with handwriting AI model to read handwritten essays.  
Long Term Scope: Implement AI handwritten essay grader for AP essay grading. 

## Responsible AI considerations

In creating this model, we want to ensure fairness in grading, a diverse training set, and fairness in scoring (through regular audits).  There also may be concerns in plagerism identification, so correlation of essays may also need to be developed in future models. In implementation, educators should have oversight to review and override scores generated by AI. Based on our objective of AP essay grading automation, the AI model may not be reasonable for use for lower ages. 

## References
A reference list with links to the references you have used, and any additional resources relevant to this topic. The reference list should include at least one relevant research paper (not news articles, medium, blog, library documentation, or LinkedIn posts) that is high quality, less than 3 years old, and from one of the research sources listed below. Note that if a project topic lists specific paper(s), they must be included and presented.
