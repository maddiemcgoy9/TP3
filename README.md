Essay readers are compensated at $30/hour plus travel expenses. Over the course of a week, 1500 teachers grade aproximately 2500 essays each costing College Board $1.8M just in labor. Additionally this greuling schedule raises questions on essay reader fatigue and its impact on the grades assigned.  
By creating an AI essay grader, AP essays could be graded faster, with less potential for score variation due to human factors.
