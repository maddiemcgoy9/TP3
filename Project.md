## Project Scope: 

Create an AI model that can evaluate short (less than 1800 words) typed essays.  
Create a simple website demo that can evaluate thesis statements.  
Create a website demo that can evaluate typed essays. 

## Project Details: With logical organization and clear but concise writeups.

Using Keras Sequential models

## What are future developments?

Mid Term Developments: Merge model with computer vision AI model to read handwritten essays.  
Long Term Developments: Testing and deployment of AI essay grader for handwritten AP essays. 

## Responsible AI considerations

- fairness in grading
- fairness in scoring (through regular audits)
- diverse training set
- plagerism identification: correlation of essays may also need to be developed in future models.
- educators should have oversight to review and override scores generated by AI.
- Based on our objective of AP essay grading automation, the AI model may not be reasonable for use for lower ages.
